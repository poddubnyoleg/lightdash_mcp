# Lightdash MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interacting with [Lightdash](https://www.lightdash.com/), enabling LLMs to discover data, create charts, and manage dashboards programmatically.

## Features

This MCP server provides a comprehensive set of tools for the full data analytics workflow:

*   **Discovery**: Explore data catalogs, find tables/explores, and understand schemas
*   **Querying**: Execute queries with full filter, metric, and aggregation support
*   **Chart Management**: Create, read, update, and delete charts with complex visualizations
*   **Dashboard Management**: Build and manage dashboards with tiles, filters, and layouts
*   **Resource Organization**: Create and manage spaces for content organization

## Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   A Lightdash instance (Cloud or self-hosted)
*   Lightdash Personal Access Token (obtain from your Lightdash profile settings)

### Quick Start with uvx (Recommended)

The easiest way to use this MCP server is with `uvx`, which will automatically download and run it:

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/<owner>/lightdash_mcp lightdash-mcp
```

### Quick Start with pipx

Alternatively, you can use `pipx`:

```bash
pipx run --spec git+https://github.com/<owner>/lightdash_mcp lightdash-mcp
```

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd lightdash_mcp
pip install .
```

### Google Cloud IAP Support

If your Lightdash instance is behind [Google Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/iap) (e.g. Cloud Run with `--iap`), install with the `iap` extra:

```bash
pip install lightdash-mcp[iap]
# or from source
pip install .[iap]
```

Set `IAP_ENABLED=true`. The server will sign a service-account JWT (audience `{LIGHTDASH_URL}/*`) via the IAM Credentials API and attach it as `Proxy-Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` on every request. The `Authorization: ApiKey` header is preserved for Lightdash.

Requirements:
- The runtime service account needs `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` on itself
- The runtime service account needs `roles/iap.httpsResourceAccessor` on the Cloud Run service

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The server requires the following environment variables:

| Variable | Required | Description | Example |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `LIGHTDASH_TOKEN` | ✅ | Your Lightdash Personal Access Token | `ldt_abc123...` |
| `LIGHTDASH_URL` | ✅ | Base URL of your Lightdash Instance | `https://app.lightdash.cloud` |
| `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` | ❌ | Cloudflare Access Client ID (if behind CF Access) | - |
| `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET` | ❌ | Cloudflare Access Client Secret (if behind CF Access) | - |
| `IAP_ENABLED` | ❌ | Enable Google Cloud IAP authentication (`true`/`1`) | `true` |

### Getting Your Lightdash Token

1. Log into your Lightdash instance
2. Go to **Settings** → **Personal Access Tokens**
3. Click **Generate new token**
4. Copy the token (starts with `ldt_`)

### Usage with Claude Desktop (uvx)

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lightdash": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "git+https://github.com/<owner>/lightdash_mcp",
        "lightdash-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LIGHTDASH_TOKEN": "ldt_your_token_here",
        "LIGHTDASH_URL": "https://app.lightdash.cloud"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage with Claude Desktop (pipx)

If you prefer `pipx`, use this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lightdash": {
      "command": "pipx",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--spec",
        "git+https://github.com/<owner>/lightdash_mcp",
        "lightdash-mcp"
      ],
      "env": {
        "LIGHTDASH_TOKEN": "ldt_your_token_here",
        "LIGHTDASH_URL": "https://app.lightdash.cloud"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: Replace `<owner>` with the GitHub username or organization hosting the repository.

### Usage with Other MCP Clients

Export the environment variables before running:

```bash
export LIGHTDASH_TOKEN="ldt_your_token_here"
export LIGHTDASH_URL="https://app.lightdash.cloud"
lightdash-mcp
```

## Development

### Adding a New Tool

The server automatically discovers and registers tools from the `tools/` directory. To add a new tool:

1.  **Create a new file** in `lightdash_mcp/tools/` (e.g., `my_new_tool.py`)

2.  **Define the tool**:
    ```python
    from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
    from .base_tool import ToolDefinition
    from .. import lightdash_client as client
    
    class MyToolInput(BaseModel):
        param1: str = Field(..., description="Description of param1")
    
    TOOL_DEFINITION = ToolDefinition(
        name="my-new-tool",
        description="Description of what this tool does",
        input_schema=MyToolInput
    )
    
    def run(param1: str) -> dict:
        """Execute the tool logic"""
        result = client.get(f"/api/v1/some/endpoint/{param1}")
        return result
    ```

3.  **Restart the server** - the tool will be automatically registered

### Tool Registry

Tools are automatically discovered via `tools/__init__.py`, which:
*   Scans the `tools/` directory for Python modules
*   Imports each module (excluding utility modules)
*   Registers tools by their `TOOL_DEFINITION.name`

### Testing

You can test individual tools by importing them:

```python
from tools import tool_registry

# List all registered tools
print(tool_registry.keys())

# Test a specific tool
result = tool_registry['list-projects'].run()
print(result)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Errors

If you see `401 Unauthorized` errors:
*   Verify your `LIGHTDASH_TOKEN` is correct and starts with `ldt_`
*   Check that the token hasn't expired
*   Ensure you have the necessary permissions in Lightdash

### Connection Errors

If you see connection errors:
*   Verify `LIGHTDASH_URL` is correct
*   For Lightdash Cloud: use `https://app.lightdash.cloud`
*   For self-hosted: use `https://your-domain.com`
*   If behind Cloudflare Access, ensure `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` and `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET` are set
*   If behind Google Cloud IAP, ensure `IAP_ENABLED=true` is set, install with `pip install lightdash-mcp[iap]`, and verify the service account has `serviceAccountTokenCreator` on itself

### Tool Not Found

If a tool isn't showing up:
*   Check that the file is in the `tools/` directory
*   Ensure the file has a `TOOL_DEFINITION` variable
*   Verify the file isn't in the exclusion list in `tools/__init__.py`
*   Restart the MCP server
